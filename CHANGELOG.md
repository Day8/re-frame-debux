### Breaking Changes

* Deletes obsolete `lazy-seq?` fn in `debux.common.util`. If for some reason
  you are using this function in your own code, it is no longer available so
  you will need to copy it to your own source. Re [PR 26](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-debux/pull/26)

### Fixed

* shadow-cljs warning 'Use of undeclared Var debux.common.util/clojure' re [PR 26](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-debux/pull/26)

## [0.5.1] - 2018-04-05

### Added

* Captured traces now include indenting information. This lets you better see the order and nesting of your function calls.

### Changed

* Don't rename symbol gensyms with three numbers or less, (e.g. `s3` is no longer renamed to `s#`).

## [0.5.0] 

Initial release after fork from debux.

### Added

* Closure-define to enable/disable tracing. Defaults to disabled, and is removed by Closure dead code elimination. To enable/disable tracing, set your compiler options to `:closure-defines {"debux.cs.core.trace_enabled_QMARK_"  true}`
